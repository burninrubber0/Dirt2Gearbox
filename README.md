# Dirt2Gearbox

Adjusts hidden settings for the transmission in Dirt 2:

* Sets the transmission type to manual with manual clutch when a manual transmission (sequential or H pattern) is selected. By default, the game uses a slower auto clutch.
* Sets the clutch button to be used as a clutch. By default, the game uses it as a brake.

# Controls

The clutch input is unmapped or not fully configured on all devices except the Logitech G25. A modified XInput action map file is provided with the release which binds it to clicking the left stick. This was only chosen because the left stick isn't bound to anything else; you are encouraged to set your own bindings.

Rebinding any controls in-game will cause the clutch to become unmapped after the next game restart. Only presets (stored in the action maps) can bind it. Thus, custom controls must be configured via the action map if you want the clutch to be enabled.

# Installation

Copy the files from the latest release to the game folder.

Your game version must be 1.1. If it is not, install [the patch](https://www.patches-scrolls.com/colin_mcrae_dirt2.php). Support for 1.0 may be added later if there is demand for it.
