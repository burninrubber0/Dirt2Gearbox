# Dirt2Gearbox

Adjusts hidden settings for the transmission in Dirt 2. Currently, it just forces the transmission type to use the manual clutch.

Uses code from [DllWrapper](https://github.com/SubstituteR/DllWrapper) and from [Matty's BPR mods](https://github.com/matty-ross/bpr-mods-repository). (Thanks Matty!)
