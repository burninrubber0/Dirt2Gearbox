# Dirt2Gearbox

Adjusts hidden settings for the transmission in Dirt 2. Currently, it just forces the transmission type to manual with manual clutch. Both sequential and H pattern work with this setting, but automatic will become manual.

# Installation

Drop the DLL in the game folder.

Your game version must be 1.1. If it is not, install [the patch](https://www.patches-scrolls.com/colin_mcrae_dirt2.php).
